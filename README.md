# Bank-Churn-Predictor
ChurnGuard is an ANN-based machine learning model that predicts whether a bank customer will stay or leave. It uses customer data to identify high-risk customers, and a Streamlit app built in VS Code provides quick, real-time churn predictions.
# ChurnGuard 🚀

**ChurnGuard** is a Deep Learning project that predicts whether a bank customer is likely to leave (churn) or stay. The project uses an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to analyze customer data such as account balance, credit score, age, activity, and transaction behavior to identify at-risk customers.

## Project Overview
Churn is a major concern for banks as retaining existing customers is often cheaper than acquiring new ones. **ChurnGuard** predicts customer churn using historical data. By identifying customers likely to leave, banks can take proactive steps to improve retention.

---

## Features
- Predicts whether a customer will stay or leave
- Uses customer attributes like:
  - Credit score
  - Age
  - Balance
  - Transaction activity
  - Tenure
- Implemented using Python, TensorFlow, and Keras
- Visualizes model accuracy and loss

---

## Dataset
The project uses a customer dataset containing various features, including:
- CustomerID
- CreditScore
- Geography
- Gender
- Age
- Tenure
- Balance
- NumberOfProducts
- HasCrCard
- IsActiveMember
- EstimatedSalary
- Exited (Target variable: 1 if the customer left, 0 if stayed)

**Note:** Dataset can be replaced with any similar bank customer dataset.
